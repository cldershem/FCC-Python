Title: Variables

Description/Explanation/Lesson:

    Variables in Python are defined using the '=' (pronounced: 'is') operator.
        Example: `my_age = 18`

    Variables can contain values such as strings, numbers, lists, class
    instances, and many more things!

    Variables can also contain the values of operations & functions
        Examples:
            ```
            eight_squared = 8 ** 2
            binary_from_decimal = bin(243)
            ```

Code Prompt/Challenge:

    1. Define a variable 'my_name' and set it to your name as a string
    2. Define a variable 'my_age' and set it to your age as a (whole) number
    3. Define a variable 'ten_more' and set it to the your age + 10

Pre-defined Code:

Solution:

    my_name = 'Ethan'
    my_age = 18
    ten_more = 18 + 10

Tests:

    self.assertIsInstance(my_name, str)
    self.assertIsInstance(my_age, int)
    self.assertIsInstance(ten_more, int)
    self.assertEqual(my_age + 10, ten_more)
