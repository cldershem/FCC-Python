This repo is for the Free Code Camp Python curriculum. Everything here is a
reference to [this issue](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/14588) on
the FCC repo.

There is no particular order to the lessons as of yet. Each lesson is a separate
module and should be treated as independent of each other.

Currently each module contains a `lesson.py` and a `tests.py`.
