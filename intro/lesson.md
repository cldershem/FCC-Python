# Introduction
Python is a general purpose programming language with a wide array of uses. It
is known for its large standard library (batteries included) and huge number of
third party libraries available.

The syntax for Python has very few keywords and symbols, making it read a lot
like English or 'pseudo code'. One unique characteristic of Python is its use of
whitespace instead of curly braces to separate blocks.

While searching for help and more information one might come across some older
posts about a rift in the Python community regarding versions. As of the
writing of this introduction, there are two officially supported versions of
Python, 2.7 and 3.6. This tutorial will be teaching Python while occasionally
pointing out differences that users may need to be aware of if they come across
legacy versions of Python code. Most of the differences are minor and all of
them are for the better. Any arguments you still see on the internet can be
chalked up to old men yelling at clouds.

While Python has been around since 1991, it has recently grown widely in
popularity as it has become a favorite for teaching, rapid prototypes, science,
websites, and data science.

## Getting Started
Python is an interpreted language, more like JavaScript than C, if you're on
Mac or Linux you've already got a Python interpreter installed, if you're on
Windows it might take an extra step or two. If you'd like to follow along on
your own machine you can follows [this instructions]() to get Python 3.6
installed.

However, for the time being at least, we will be using a REPL on the web.

REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop. All you need to know now is that
when you type something after the `>>> ` prompt, the computer with interpret
it and evaluate its meaning before showing you the results.

## REPL
```
# The `>>> ` symbol is the prompt in the Python interpretter
>>> this is where you type
output comes out here
```

## Give it a try!
```
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

Don't worry about what any of that means for now. You'll start to understand \
it all later
